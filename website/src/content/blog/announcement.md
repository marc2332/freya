## hey 👋

I'm [Marc](https://github.com/marc2332/) and I am happy to announce the first alpha (**v0.1**) of [**Freya**](https://github.com/marc2332/freya), an experimental cross-platform native GUI library for 🦀 [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), built on top of **🧬** [**Dioxus**](https://dioxuslabs.com/) and powered by the 🖼️ [Skia](https://skia.org/) library.

### What is Freya 🦀 ?

**Freya** is a GUI library that extends **Dioxus** by adding its own **renderer** based on **Skia** with the help of a custom layout library, its own **elements** **namespace**, **attributes** and **events**, plus a set of **components** and **hooks**, and also some developer tools like a **Devtools** panel or a **headless components testing runner**.

#### **Do you want to try it?**

Read [this](https://github.com/marc2332/freya#want-to-try-it-). Just be aware that it is still in the ⚠️ experimentation phase, I would like this first release to be an opportunity to gather feedback, suggestions, new contributions and ideas!

### What is Dioxus 🧬 ?

**Dioxus** is a renderer-agnostic UI library for Rust, like React. It uses [**components**](https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.4/reference/components) as functions and [**hooks**](https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.4/reference/hooks). It supports many renderers: web, backend with SSR, liveview and fullstack, desktop and mobile with webview, desktop with WGPU, or even TUI.

[Learn more about Dioxus.](https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.4/guide/your_first_component/) And see the [differences](https://book.freyaui.dev/differences_with_dioxus.html) with Freya.

### Reasons to use Freya ✅

* **Dioxus**: very easy to use, it's blazingly fast and has a bright future.
    
* **Native renderer**: Looks the same on all platforms and avoids compatibility issues
    
* **Built-in Components and hooks:** From a simple Button to a VirtualScrollView or animation utilities.
    
* **Headless testing runner**: Make sure your components work before making a release.
    
* **Languages**: Just Rust!
    

### Reasons to not use Freya ❌

* **It's still experimental**: it might contain bugs, have performance issues or some APIs not being fully usable yet.
    
* **Lack of ecosystem**: You can use renderer-agnostic libraries of Dioxus but it is still a small ecosystem, and non-existent for Freya.
    
* **Lack of docs**: Some things are not fully documented and others could be improved.
    

## Example

Here there is a simple counter app with Freya (source code [here](https://github.com/marc2332/freya/blob/main/examples/counter.rs)):

```rust
fn app(cx: Scope) -> Element {
    let mut count = use_state(cx, || 0);

    render!(
        rect {
            height: "20%",
            width: "100%",
            background: "rgb(233, 196, 106)",
            padding: "12",
            color: "rgb(20, 33, 61)",
            label { 
                font_size: "20", 
                "Number is: {count}"
            }
        }
        rect {
            height: "80%",
            width: "100%",
            background: "rgb(168, 218, 220)",
            color: "black",
            padding: "12",
            onclick: move |_| count += 1,
            label { "Click to increase!" }
        }
    )
}
```

* macOS
    

It could technically run on more platforms, like Mobile or Web via Wasm, feel free to contribute 😁

## 🔄 Hot reload

Freya supports **Dioxus's hot reload**, which means that you can write and update the **layout**, **styling** and other static **attributes** of your components without having to recompile any rust code, it updates on the fly.

[Demo](https://twitter.com/mkenzo_8/status/1631956848176668672)

## 🧰 Testing

Freya supports **headless testing** of components, you can simulate from the window size to events, like mouse or keyboard, and also assert the layout or text values of your components.

Simple example:

```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn no_state() {
    fn no_state_app(cx: Scope) -> Element {
        render!(
            label {
                "Hello"
            }
        )
    }

    let mut utils = launch_test(no_state_app);

    assert_eq!(utils.root().get(0).get(0).text(), Some("Hello"));
}
```

A more complex example that even simulates click events:

```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn simulate_events() {
    fn stateful_app(cx: Scope) -> Element {
        let enabled = use_state(cx, || false);
        render!(
            rect {
                width: "100%",
                height: "100%",
                background: "red",
                direction: "both",
                onclick: |_| {
                    enabled.set(true);
                },
                label {
                    "Is enabled? {enabled}"
                }
            }
        )
    }

    let mut utils = launch_test(stateful_app);

    let rect = utils.root().get(0);
    let label = rect.get(0);

    // Inital render
    utils.wait_for_update().await;

    let text = label.get(0);

    assert_eq!(text.text(), Some("Is enabled? false"));

    utils.push_event(FreyaEvent::Mouse {
        name: "click".to_string(),
        cursor: (5.0, 5.0).into(),
        button: Some(MouseButton::Left),
    });

    // New render after clicking
    utils.wait_for_update().await;

    let text = label.get(0);

    assert_eq!(text.text(), Some("Is enabled? true"));
}
```

## 🔍 DevTools

Freya integrates an experimental **DevTools panel** to help you navigate and inspect the elements of your app while you are developing. It is not included in release builds.

You can do:

* Inspect the DOM
    
* Inspect element's styles
    
* Inspect the element's computed layout

## 📆 Roadmap

* More **elements**, **components**, **hooks** and **events**.
    
* Better performance, both for **rendering** and **layout**.
    
* Better developer tools (**Devtools panel**, **test runner**, etc)
    
* More and better **documentation**
    

I am aware Freya is not perfect, and it will take some time to be production-ready, but I am sure it will keep getting better.
