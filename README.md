**Freya** is a cross-platform GUI library for Rust powered by 🧬 [Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com) and 🎨 [Skia](https://skia.org/). 

**It does not use any web tech**, check the [Differences with Dioxus](https://book.freyaui.dev/differences_with_dioxus.html). 

⚠️ It's currently work in progress, but you can already play with it! You can join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/sYejxCdewG) server if you have any question or issue.
