# Environment Setup

Make sure you have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and your OS dependencies installed.

### Windows

You will need C++ build tools which you can get through Visual Studio 2022, learn more [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/rust/setup#install-visual-studio-recommended-or-the-microsoft-c-build-tools).

### Linux

#### Debian-based (Ubuntu, PopOS, etc)

Install these packages:
```sh
sudo apt install build-essential libssl-dev pkg-config cmake libgtk-3-dev libclang-dev
```

Don't hesitate to contribute so other distros can be added here.

### MacOS

No setup required. But feel free to add more if we miss something.
