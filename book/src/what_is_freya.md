### Why 🧬 Dioxus?

[Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com) is a React-like library for Rust. Its component and hooks model make it simple to use and scale to complex apps. 
Freya uses some of Dioxus core crates to build it's own renderer, this is because Dioxus is to it's core a renderer-agnostic UI library.
See other [differences](./differences_with_dioxus.html) with Freya.

### Why 🎨 Skia?

[Skia](https://skia.org/) is a battle-tested and well-maintained graphics library, and there are even some rusty [bindings](https://github.com/rust-skia/rust-skia).
