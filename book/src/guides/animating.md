# Animating

Freya provides you with two hooks to help you animate your components.

### `use_animation`

This a very simple hook that will let you animate a certain value from an `inital` value to a `final` value, in a given `duration` of time. There are a few animations that you can choose from:

- Linear
- EaseIn
- EaseInOut
- BounceIns

Here is an example that will animate a value from `0.0` to `100.0` in `50` milliseconds, using the `linear` animation.

```rust, no_run
fn main() {
    launch(app);
}

 fn app(cx: Scope) -> Element {
    let animation = use_animation(cx, || 0.0);

    let progress = animation.value();

    use_memo(cx, (), move |_| {
        animation.start(Animation::new_linear(0.0..=100.0, 50));
    });

    render!(rect {
        width: "{progress}",
    })
}
```

### `use_animation_transition`

This hook let's you group a set of animations together with a certain type of `animation` and a given `duration`. You can also specifiy a set of dependencies that will make animations callback re run.

Just like `use_animation` you have these animations:

- Linear
- EaseIn
- EaseInOut
- BounceIns

Here is an example that will animate a `size` and a color in `200` milliseconds, using the `new_sine_in_out` animation.

```rust, no_run
fn main() {
    launch(app);
}

const TARGET: f64 = 500.0;

fn app(cx: Scope) -> Element {
    let animation = use_animation_transition(cx, TransitionAnimation::new_sine_in_out(200), (), || {
        vec![
            Animate::new_size(0.0, TARGET),
            Animate::new_color("rgb(33, 158, 188)", "white"),
        ]
    });

    let size = animation.get(0).unwrap().as_size();
    let background = animation.get(1).unwrap().as_color();

    let onclick = move |_: MouseEvent| {
        if size == 0.0 {
            animation.start();
        } else if size == TARGET {
            animation.reverse();
        }
    };

    render!(
        rect {
            overflow: "clip",
            background: "black",
            width: "100%",
            height: "100%",
            offset_x: "{size}",
            rect {
                height: "100%",
                width: "200",
                background: "{background}",
                onclick: onclick,
            }
        }
    )
}
```
