# Frequently Asked Questions

## Will Freya have Mobile/Web support?
Freya current focus is on Desktop (Windows, Linux, MacOS), so there is no plans for either Mobile (Android/iOS) or Web support. But, this doesn't mean it won't happen in the future, who knows! From a technical point of view, it is possible to run Freya on these platforms with the right adjustements.

## Why Skia instead of Webview?
These are the main reasons for this:
- Ability to define the elements, attributes, styling, layout and events to my own criteria
- Apps UI look the same no matter the platform
- Because Freya has control over all the the pipeline it is easier to implement and use certain features such as headless testing runner
- Not relying on OS for new features or fixes
