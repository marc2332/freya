/// like a button with a different color.
/// To avoid cluttering your components with router-specific code you might instead want to wrap your component in an `ActivableRoute`
/// and inside your component call `use_activable_route`.
///
/// This way, your component and all its desdendants will just know whether a route is activated or not, but not which one.
///
/// ```rs
/// Link {
///     to: Route::Home, // Direction route
///     ActivableRoute {
///         route: Route::Home, // Activation route
///         SidebarItem {
///             // `SidebarItem` will now appear "activated" when the route is `Route::Home`
///             // `ActivableRoute` is letting it know whether `Route::Home` is enabled
///             // or not, without the need to add router-specific logic in `SidebarItem`.
///             label {
///                 "Go to Hey ! ðŸ‘‹"
