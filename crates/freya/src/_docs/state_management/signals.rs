//! # Signals
//!
//! Signals are a state management solution built-in into Dioxus. They are simple reactive value containers that simplify the mutation and reading of state, even across components.
//!
//! They are usually created by using the `use_signal` hook.
//!
//! ### Example
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use freya::prelude::*;
//! fn app() -> Element {
//!     let mut count = use_signal(|| 0);
//!     // The closure passed to `use_signal` will be called only
//!     // the first time this component renders,
//!     // it will return the initial value for the Signal.
//!     // This closure is to prevent having to create the initial value
//!     // every time the component runs again, as it is only needed the first time.
//!
//!     let onclick = move |_| {
//!         count += 1; // Shorthand for count.write() += 1;
//!         // The moment the signal is mutated it will notify
//!         // all the components that have a read subscription
//!         // to this signal (in this case, only `app`)
//!         // that there has been a change.
//!         // When that happens they will renders again
//!         // and thus producing the new UI.
//!     };
//!
//!     rsx!(
//!         label {
//!             onclick,
//!             "{count}"
//!             // Because the signal is being read here,
//!             // everytime that it gets mutated, this component
//!             // will rerender as it has a read subscription.
//!             // "{count}" is the same as using "{count.read()}".
//!         }
//!     )
//! }
//! ```
