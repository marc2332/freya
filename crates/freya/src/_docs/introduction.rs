//! # Introduction
//!
//! **Freya** is a Rust 🦀 library to make GUI applications that are **cross-platform**, which means they will run the same way in Windows, macOS and Linux.
//!
//! It uses a model where you compose the app by splitting the UI in different components that return pieces of UI or call other components, this is because
//! Freya runs on 🧬 [Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com), a renderer-agnostic UI library inspired by ReactJS.
//!
//! Even though you might have seen that Dioxus render to HTML, use CSS/JavaScript/WASM/WebView/WGPU. this does not apply to Freya. In fact, Freya only uses some of the core
//! crates of Dioxus, which means that you will be writing Dioxus components and using some of its APIs but, the elements, attributes, styling, layout, events, and more things
//! will be provided by Freya.
//!
//! Freya uses 🎨 [Skia](https://skia.org/) as rendering engine because its a very battle tested library and has great support for a lot of features.
//!
//! #### Example
//!
//! ```rust, no_run
//! # use freya::prelude::*;
//! fn main() {
//!     // **Start** your app by specifying the root component and some config parameters
//!     launch_with_props(app, "Counter", (400.0, 350.0));
//! }
//!
//! fn app() -> Element {
//!    // Define a **state**
//!    let mut count = use_signal(|| 0);
//!
//!    // Declare the **UI**
//!    rsx!(
//!        rect {
//!            height: "100%",
//!            width: "100%",
//!            background: "rgb(35, 35, 35)",
//!            color: "white",
//!            padding: "12",
//!            onclick: move |_| count += 1, // **Update** the state on click events
//!            label { "Click to increase -> {count}" } // Display the **state**
//!        }
//!    )
//! }
//! ```
