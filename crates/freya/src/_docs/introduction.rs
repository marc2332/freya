//! # Introduction
//!
//! **Freya** is a Rust 🦀 library to make GUI applications that are [**cross-platform**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-platform_software), targeting in Windows, macOS and Linux.
//!
//! Freya uses a [declarative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming) model for the UI, and components to encapculate the UI in reusable pieces of code. This is because
//! Freya uses the core crates 🧬 [Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com), a renderer-agnostic components-based and declarative UI library inspired by ReactJS.
//!
//! You might have seen that Dioxus render to HTML, use CSS/JavaScript/WASM/WebView/WGPU. this does not apply to Freya.
//!
//! Agin, Freya only uses some of the core crates of Dioxus, meaning that you will be writing Dioxus components and using some of its APIs but, the elements, attributes, styling, layout, events,
//! and the rest of things will be provided by Freya.
//!
//! Freya also uses 🎨 [Skia](https://skia.org/) as rendering engine because its a very battle tested library and has great support for a lot of features.
//!
//! #### Example
//!
//! ```rust, no_run
//! # use freya::prelude::*;
//! fn main() {
//!     // **Start** your app by specifying the root component and some config parameters
//!     launch_with_props(app, "Counter", (400.0, 350.0));
//! }
//!
//! fn app() -> Element {
//!    // Define a **state**
//!    let mut count = use_signal(|| 0);
//!
//!    // Declare the **UI**
//!    rsx!(
//!        rect {
//!            height: "100%",
//!            width: "100%",
//!            background: "rgb(35, 35, 35)",
//!            color: "white",
//!            padding: "12",
//!            onclick: move |_| count += 1, // **Update** the state on click events
//!            label { "Click to increase -> {count}" } // Display the **state**
//!        }
//!    )
//! }
//! ```
