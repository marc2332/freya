//! # Components
//!
//! Freya apps will usually be composed of different components.
//! Components are defined in the form functions that might receive some input as **Props** and return the UI as **Element**.
//!
//! > You can learn more about how the UI is defined in the [UI](./ui.md) chapter.
//!
//! This is how a simple root component looks like:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use freya::prelude::*;
//! // Usually, the root component of a Freya app is named `app`,
//! // but it is not a requirement
//! fn app() -> Element {
//!     rsx!(
//!         label {
//!             "Hello, World!"
//!         }
//!     )
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! This is obviously fine, but the moment our app grows in size and complexity we might want to split
//! things out in order to maintain a certain level of modularity and reusability. We can do this by spliting the UI in different components
//!
//! For example, lets create a reusable component:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use freya::prelude::*;
//! fn app() -> Element {
//!     rsx!(
//!         // By declaring this element using `TextLabel`
//!         // we are creating an instance of that component
//!         TextLabel {
//!             text: "Number 1"
//!         }
//!         label {
//!             "Number 2"
//!         }
//!         // Another instance of the same component
//!         TextLabel {
//!             text: "Number 3"
//!         }
//!     )
//! }
//!
//! // Reusable component that we might call as many times we want
//! #[component]
//! fn TextLabel(text: String) -> Element {
//!     rsx!(
//!         label {
//!             "{text}"
//!         }
//!     )
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Notice how we anotate our `TextLabel` component with the macro `#[component]`, this will transform every argument of the function (just `text: String` in this case) to a component prop, so we can later use the component prop in a declarative way in the RSX.
//!
//! For more complex components you might want to put the props in an external struct intead of using the `#[components]` macro:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use freya::prelude::*;
//! #[derive(Props, PartialEq, Clone)]
//! struct TextLabelProps {
//!     text: String
//! }
//!
//! fn TextLabel(TextLabelProps { text }: TextLabelProps) -> Element {
//!     rsx!(
//!         label {
//!             "{text}"
//!         }
//!     )
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Renders
//!
//! Components renders are just when a component function runs, which might be because it is subscribed to a signal and that signal got mutated, or because its props changed.
//!
//! > Even though the naming might give you the impression that it means the app will effectively rerender again, it has nothing to do with it, in fact, a component might render a thousand times but it it doesn't generate a new UI Freya will not rerender it.
//!
//! Consider this simple component:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use freya::prelude::*;
//! #[component]
//! fn CoolComp() -> Element {
//!     let mut count = use_signal(|| 0);
//!
//!     // 1 run of this function means 1 render of this component
//!     // So, everytime the `count` signal is mutated, the component rerenders/is recalled.
//!
//!     rsx!(
//!         label {
//!             // Update the signal value
//!             onclick: move |_| count += 1,
//!
//!             // By embedding the count in this text the component is subscried to any change in the `count` siganal
//!             "Increase {count}"
//!         }
//!     )
//! }
//! ```
